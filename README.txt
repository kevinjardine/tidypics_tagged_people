This small plugin adds a few small improvements to Tidypic's user tagging. 
This includes a sentence explaining how the autocomplete box works, easier
ways to cancel the tag creation popup, and a sidebar area showing the avatars
of everyone tagged in an image. Mousing over a sidebar avatar reveals the
related tag box on the image.
